# ESP8266 Projects

This repository contains a small number of projects for use with/on the ESP8266 chip, as packaged by the WeMos Mini D1.


## Helsinki Tram Display

The [d1-helsinki-tram-times](d1-helsinki-tram-times) project shows the departure times of Trams in Helsinki, and is more fully documented [on the project homepage](https://steve.fi/Hardware/helsinki-tram-times/).

## NTP-Based Clock

The [d1-ntp-clock](d1-ntp-clock) does exactly what the name implies, operates as a clock getting the time via NTP.

The project is documented [on the project homepage](https://steve.fi/Hardware/d1-ntp-clock/).


## Rick-Roll Access Point

The [mobile-rr](mobile-rr) project is an access-point & captive portal that pretends to offer free WiFi, but instead [rickrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling) visitors.

* This is __not my project__, but was very interesting to read and cleanup.

## Weather Station

The [d1-weather-station](d1-weather-station) uses an OLED display to show the current date, time, weather-summary & three-day summary via remote HTTP fetches from wunderground.com.

* This is __not my project__, but was very interesting to read and cleanup.
