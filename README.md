# ESP8266 Projects

This repository contains a small number of projects for use with/on the ESP8266 chip, as packaged by the WeMos Mini D1.


## Helsinki Tram Display

The [d1-helsinki-tram-times](d1-helsinki-tram-times) project shows the departure times of Trams in Helsinki, and is more fully documented [on the project homepage](https://steve.fi/Hardware/helsinki-tram-times/).

## NTP-Based Clock

The [d1-ntp-clock](d1-ntp-clock) does exactly what the name implies, operates as a clock getting the time via NTP.

The project is documented [on the project homepage](https://steve.fi/Hardware/d1-ntp-clock/).
