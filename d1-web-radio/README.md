# Web-Controlled Radio

This project combines an ESP8266 processor with a TEA5767-based radio-receiver.

The project will boot up, and if a WiFi network is known it will connect to it,
then present a simple web-server to show you the currently tuned radio-station.
There are buttons for changing to a known-frequency, or searching up/down the spetrum to find another station.

If no wifi-details are saved it will serve as an access-point, named WEB-RADIO, allowing you to provide the networking-details to join to.
